# News-Desk-App
This project is a news desk website that sorts current news articles for users by headline tags and sources. The main goal of this project was to further familiarize myself with many of the Web Application Frameworks used today in professional software development. It was planned, designed, developed, and tested over the course of a week.

## Project Features:
>__Live page updates__: Uses Vue.js and fetch API to send data updates to and receive updates from the backend without reloading the page.  
>__User creation and Authentication__: Website supports creation of and login of users. User preferences are automatically saved to their profiles in the database.  
>__Web Scraping Module__: Modular web scraping app that allows for easy content expansion through the website's admin portal.  

## Technologies Used:
>__Django__: for backend data management. Utilized the object-relational mapping layer to interact with the database.

>__Sqlite3__: for database.
